Used Naive Bayes algorithm to build the model.
Naive bayes algorithm talks about conditional probability.
All input values are independent events and output values are dependent events.
Taken the data of play occured during different weather conditions from kaggle.
It contains outlook, temparature, humidity, windy columuns that are given to x and play to y.
Converted text data into the numerical data using factorize command from pandas.
Printed confusion matrix = [2], accuracy = 1
by giving different weather conditions we can predict the possibility of play occurance.
